- ~~Save a directory tree of all git repositories in a root directory to a config file ( .diroctor.yml )~~
- ~~Re install all of the repositories in a separate place~~
- ~~Add posibility to override default config values with cli input~~
- Deploy to NPM
- Update README
- Ask for prompt when the recovery folder exists and is not empty to delete the contents of the folder
- Store a version with which the config file was created to ensure people use compatible version of the library
- Extract all filesystem path methods to a separate file for easier testing
- Have a daemon that will check for changes in the root folder and subfolders and re-create the tree
