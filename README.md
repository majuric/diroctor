- Save a directory tree of all git repositories in a root directory to a config file ( .diroctor.yml )
- Have a daemon that will check for changes in the root folder and subfolders and re-create the tree
- Re install all of the repositories in a separate place
- Store a version with which the config file was created to ensure people use compatible version of the library
- Keep the name of the folder in case it differs from the repository name
- Ask for prompt when the recovery folder exists and is not empty to delete the contents of the folder
- Add posibility to override default config values with cli input
